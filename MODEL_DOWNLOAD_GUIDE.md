# Model Download Guide

## üéØ Trained Model Status

Your AI image generation app has been successfully trained with excellent results:
- **Best Loss**: 0.0213 (very good!)
- **Training Date**: July 9, 2025
- **Base Model**: `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`

## üìÅ Model Files Location

The trained model files are located in:
```
ai-image-app/backend/quality_training_outputs/best_model/
```

### Required Files:
- `config.json` - Model configuration ‚úÖ (included in repo)
- `training_info.json` - Training metadata ‚úÖ (included in repo)
- `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors` - Model weights (3.2GB) ‚ùå (excluded from repo)

## üöÄ How to Get the Model Files

### Option 1: Use Your Local Model (Recommended)
If you trained this model locally, the files are already in your `quality_training_outputs/best_model/` directory.

### Option 2: Download from Cloud Storage
The model files are too large for GitHub. You can:

1. **Upload to Hugging Face Hub** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   # Install huggingface_hub
   pip install huggingface_hub
   
   # Login to Hugging Face
   huggingface-cli login
   
   # Upload your model
   cd ai-image-app/backend/quality_training_outputs/best_model/
   huggingface-cli upload your-username/your-model-name .
   ```

2. **Upload to Google Drive/Dropbox**:
   - Upload the `best_model/` folder
   - Share the download link in your README

3. **Use Git LFS** (if you want to keep it in GitHub):
   ```bash
   # Install Git LFS
   git lfs install
   
   # Track large files
   git lfs track "*.safetensors"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add ai-image-app/backend/quality_training_outputs/best_model/
   git commit -m "Add model files with Git LFS"
   ```

## üîß Using the Model

Once you have the model files, you can use them with:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

# Load your custom model
model_path = "ai-image-app/backend/quality_training_outputs/best_model/"
pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_path,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    safety_checker=None
)

# Generate images
prompt = "your custom prompt here"
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("generated_image.png")
```

## üìä Model Performance

- **Training Loss**: 0.0213 (excellent convergence)
- **Epochs**: 2
- **Learning Rate**: 5e-05
- **Batch Size**: 2

This model should produce high-quality images that match your training data style and characteristics.
